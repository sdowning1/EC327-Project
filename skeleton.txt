to do:
  - learn buttons in sfml
  - tic toc
  - shapes (scope)
  - libraries (SFML, timing library?)

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <chrono>
#include <ctime>
#include <SFML/Graphics.hpp>

class elements
  shape:
  - circle
  - square
  - triangle
  color:
  - red
  - blue
  - green

int main

build home screen - start button

while (!start)
  stall

while ( answering time AT !=  0) {
  
  create vector of N random elements

  while ( memorizing time MT !=0 ) {
    display the vector for T seconds
  }
  reset MT;

  clear the window
  stall for 1 or 2 seconds

  if ( N > long sequence)
    right answer = random nth element;
  else right answer = entire vector;

  tic
  while ( answer.size() != right answer.size() ) {
    give prompt (give entire sequence or nth element)
    draw input buttons
    answer.pushback(button)
  }
  toc

  TT = toc - tic

  AT = AT - TT;

  if ( answer == right answer)
    N = N + 1;
    correct = correct + 1;
  else
    consecutive wrong = consecutive wrong + 1;
    num wrong = num wrong + 1;

  if (consecutive wrong == 2)
    N = N - 1;
    consecutive wrong == 0;
}

clear window

draw end screen
  - score
    - accuracy (correct / correct + num wrong)
    - max N
  - play again
