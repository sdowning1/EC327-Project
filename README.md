# EC327-Project, Group 20, "Memory Tester"

Instructions:
1. Download final_memorygame2.cpp, makefile, and scoreboard.txt and place them under the same directory.
2. You may edit the values in scoreboard.txt (it has samples from when we played the game), but it must follow the format: accuracy1 *white space* max_length1 *white space* accuracy2 *white space* max_length2 *white space* ... and so on.
4. Using a linux terminal, run the command "make memory_game" to compile the cpp program.
5. Now run "memory".
6. The game window should pop up and you may start playing.
